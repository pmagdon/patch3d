# Patch3d #

Patch3d is a program written in C++ to calculate patch metrics based on a 3d landscape model. It implements the algorithm developed by [Jenness (2004)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3784807) for surface area calculation. It is developed at the [Chair of Forest Inventory and Remote Sensing](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/67094.html), within the project [SenFraTric](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~pmagdon/SenFraTric/SenFraTric.html) which is  financially support by the German research foundation [DFG](http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp).
